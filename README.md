# Spiral Matrix

View on [GH Pages] (https://twyststar.github.io/spiralMatrix/)

## Description

A build for a puzzle challenge. Given a matrix array with a spiral layout:

* First write a function to return the elements of the matrix sorted numerically

* Second build a page with a 5x5 grid with the following features: 

  * All numbers in the matrix printed as they originally appeared (counting in a spiral)
  
  * A button that will start an animation

  * The animation will somehow highlight the numbers in numeric order, one after the other, so it appears to light-up in a spiral

  * An area for the sorted output, that will not populate until _after_ the animation has run

  * A button that will reset the page

## The Matrix

`const matrix = [
  [1,2,3,4,5],
  [16,17,18,19,6],
  [15,24,25,20,7],
  [14,23,22,21,8],
  [13,12,11,10,9]
]`
